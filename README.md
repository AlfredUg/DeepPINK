DeepPINK: reproducible feature selection in deep neural networks

This repository will be updated with code to replicate the paper "DeepPINK: reproducible feature selection in deep neural networks" by
Yang Young Lu*, Yingying Fan*, Jinchi Lv, & William Stafford Noble

If you want to have early access to the code and data, here is the un-organized messy version which contains everything:

(1) data and code:
